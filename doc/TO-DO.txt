CHALLENGES
    1) https://www.openshift.com/forums/openshift/automate-addition-of-database-in-cartridge

    2) jbpm REST API and implementation bundled with everything else
       A runtime artifact that only exposes the jbpm engine via a REST API doesn't currently exist.
       So for the purposes of this cartridge, this runtime artifact was built by cherry-picking functionality found in a variety of different locations:
         a) jbpm functionality is found here:
             https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm

            -in particular, CDI beans are found here:
                1)  https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm/jbpm-runtime-manager
                2)  https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm/jbpm-services/jbpm-kie-services
         b) the REST API that exposes jbpm is found here:
             https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-integration/tree/master/kie-remote/kie-services-remote
         c) the 'kitchen-sink' runtime web artifact of all droolsjbpm family functionality is found here:
             https://github.com/droolsjbpm/kie-wb-distributions

    3) jbpm-kie-services-6.0.0.jar
        - this library includes both API and CDI service implementations.  Ideal would be separation between the two. 
        - I'm interested in only a sub-set of API & CDI services packaged in this library
        - Yet if i choose to use this library, I'm forced to include dependencies in my runtime for services that I don't want.



TO-DO
    - use bpms.deployer.zip from official jbpm / drools community projects once finalized by jbpm engineering team
    - package contents of existing bpms.deployer.zip as RPMs
    - begin process of submittal of jbpm6 RPMs to Fedora packaging team 
    - inject JMS AuditLogger from org.jbpm.process.audit.AuditLoggerFactory into kieSession

ADDITIONAL
    1)  REST API:  history/clear ..... alternative would be to accept the DELETE http method on the /history resource
